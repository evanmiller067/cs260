Here is my housing program, I used a tutor, cplusplus.com, and the supplied examples on d2l, 
so my functions will match pretty close to those. I was able to match your expected output, 
except for the one, two, or three whitespace characters added after the listed friend names.
Thanks for taking the time to teach us!
